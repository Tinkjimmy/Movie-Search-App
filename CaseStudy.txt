**Duration:** 1–2 days

---

### 🎯 **Goal**

Create a clean, user-friendly interface for searching movies using the OMDb API. Practice API integration, React state management, and component-based architecture.

---

### ⚙️ **Functionality Overview**

### 🧪 Challenges & Solutions

| Challenge | Solution |
|----------|----------|
| React Modal not opening | Used `onClick` instead of incorrect `onSelect` on movie card |
| Image path issues in CSS | Moved background image to `src/assets/` for proper bundling |
| API key exposure | Stored API key in `.env` and accessed via `process.env.REACT_APP_OMDB_API_KEY` |

### 🔮 Potential Additions

- Pagination for long search results
- Improved error display for failed searches
- Loading spinner animation
- Local storage for "favorite" movies
